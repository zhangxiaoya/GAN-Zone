# GAN-Zone
Papers, Materials, Tutorials, Projects, Codes About Deep Neural Network -- GAN

In this repository records the meterials, tutorials, papers, and projects of depth neural network GAN that I usually collected.

1. The first one is about the theory and practice of GAN util to now, the article is at here -- [New Progress on GAN Theory and Practice](https://casmls.github.io/general/2017/04/13/gan.html)

2. The second one is a paper and project list of GAN, and this list is at here -- [really-awesome-gan](https://github.com/nightrome/really-awesome-gan), this is a Github repository and meybe update in the future.

## Other Meterials

Besides of these two articles, there are also other Meterials, such as NIPS Workshop, technical blogs, tutorials, etc.
