# GAN-Zone
Papers, Materials, Tutorials, Projects, Codes About Deep Neural Network -- GAN

In this repository records the meterials, tutorials, papers, and projects of depth neural network GAN that I usually collected.

1. The first one is about the theory and practice of GAN util to now, the artical is at here -- [New Progress on GAN Theory and Practice](https://casmls.github.io/general/2017/04/13/gan.html)

2. The second one is a paper and project list of GAN, and this list is at here -- [really-awesome-gan](https://github.com/nightrome/really-awesome-gan), this is a Github repository and meybe update in the future.

## Other Meterials

Besides of these two articals, there are also other Meterials, such as NIPS Workshop, technical blogs, tutorials, etc.

### NIPS Workshop 2016

1. The first one is the homepage of NIPS 2016, the it is at here -- [NIPS 2016 Workshop on Adversarial Training](https://sites.google.com/site/nips2016adversarial/)

2. The second one is one blog artical about this Workshop, and it is at here -- [New Perspectives on Adversarial Training ](http://www.inference.vc/my-summary-of-adversarial-training-nips-workshop/)

### Gihub Repository

I found one github repository which owned by an indian guy, and there are list of projects or articals which named GAN, the repository is at here -- [the-gan-zoo](https://github.com/hindupuravinash/the-gan-zoo)

### Tutorials and Technotical Blogs

1. How to Train a GAN? Tips and tricks to make GANs work. It is at here -- [ganhacks](https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks)
2. There is one Tutorial on NIPS 2016 for GAN, it is at here -- [NIPS 2016 Tutorial: Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.00160)
3. [On the intuition behind deep learning & GANs — towards a fundamental understanding](https://blog.waya.ai/introduction-to-gans-a-boxing-match-b-w-neural-nets-b4e5319cc935)
4. There is one post of OpenAI for Generative Models, it is at here -- [Generative Models](https://blog.openai.com/generative-models/)
5. [SimGANs - a game changer in unsupervised learning, self driving cars, and more](https://blog.waya.ai/simgans-applied-to-autonomous-driving-5a8c6676e36b)
